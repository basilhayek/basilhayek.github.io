## COVID and Game Theory

Over the break I had a chance to do some reading. I skew towards non-fiction and wanted something that would get me thinking and was light enough to handle regular interruptions. 

Properly primed, when reading news on COVID and individual's responses to social distancing, it became obvious that the choice to follow mandates or ignore them was a version of the prisoner's dilemma.

### Scenario
Let's imagine we have two players, who live in a city where COVID rates have been increasing. The mayor has closed most business and put in place a stay-at-home advisory--but not an order--for the next three weeks. Players must decide between going out and socializing with friends or sitting on their couch and watching Netflix.

If both players stay at home during those three weeks, the COVID rate drops and the advisory is lifted, and gyms and restaurants reopen. If both players goes out, the COVID rate spikes and the advisory will move to a strictly enforced lockdown for three weeks. If only one player goes out, they get to experience the fun of a night out, but the advisory is extended for an additional three weeks.

### The Payoff Matrix
We'll start with the payoff for both individuals staying home--it's not fun staying at home, but would be worth it if the advisory is lifted (value 5).

If one individual goes out, they get the benefit of going out, which keeps their spirits up through the additional three weeks of the advisory lockdown (value 8). For the individual who stayed home, they are really regretting their decision as know they're stuck at home for another three weeks (value 0).

If both individuals go out, they get to experience the joy of a night out, but then will be 

On the flipside, if COVID rates increase and the advisory becomes a lockdown order, that has negative value. For a player that stayed home on their couch, the value would be -1. If the player got a chance to go out before the lockdown, we'll say they had a value of 5. 

Now, from an individual perspective, the best payoff comes from going out. Getting a chance to catch up and socialize with friends--assuming a lockdown doesn't get put in place--has a value of 10. However, if a lockdown does get put in place, the overall value to that player is halved to five.

Staying at home isn't that fun. But from a light at the end of the tunnel perspective, it's worth staying home if the advisory is lifted, so we'll give that a score of 5.

We're making generous assumptions and simplifications here.

### The Result
In the matrix below, the orange shaded box shows how we expect the game to play out. Given that neither player knows that the other will do, it is preferrable for them to avoid the payout of 0, which could be a possiblity if they choose to stay home. If they choose to go out, the least value they'll get is 3. 

A simple way to look at this is by examining the decision two individuals need to make on whether to stay at home or socialize with friends. The value of going out is high; we'll arbitarily assign a value of 8 to this choice. This of course assumes that the pandemic runs its current course without more  - we'll set this arbitarily at 8. The value of 

on following a stay-at-home advisory or going out to socialize with friends. Although in the real world this would be a n-player prisoner's dilemma, we'll pretend there's just two people.



Of course, this is not just between two players. This is an n-player prisoner's dilemma, sometimes explored as the "Tragedy of the Commons" where societal and individual needs are not aligned.
