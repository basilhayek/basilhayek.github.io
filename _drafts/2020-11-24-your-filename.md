I've picked up playing bass again, which means a lot of relearning of songs that I once knew.

I use Ultimate Guitar for my tabs, and while they've [introduced auto-scroll](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1976744) for some songs, it's not universal, and I have yet to see a bass tab with this feature.

## The idea

### Components

I'll need the following components:
1. A way to scroll a page contained in an iframe
2. A page that automatically scrolls based on a time interval
3. A way to sync the scroll to the song I'm playing
4. (Ideally) A way to easily capture when to scroll
