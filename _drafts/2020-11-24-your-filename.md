I've picked up playing bass again, which means a lot of relearning of songs that I once knew.

## The idea

### Components

I'll need the following components:
1. A way to scroll a page contained in an iframe
2. A page that automatically scrolls based on a time interval
3. (Ideally) A way to sync the scroll
4. (Ideally) A way to easily capture when to scroll
